          <p class="p-regular">
            Request information about how we collect, process, use and share

            of the new data you provide to us.
          </p>

          <p class="p-regular">
            <b> Request erasure </b>of your Personal Data (commonly known as a

            processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to
            erase your Personal Data to comply with local law. Note, however,
            that we may not always be able to comply in full with your request
            of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you,

            on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to
            object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct
            marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
            compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which

          <p class="p-regular">
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is
            not completely secure. Although we are committed to protecting your
            Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your information
            transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once
            we have received your information, we use a variety of
            industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help
            protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or
            disclosure. We also require you to enter a password to access your
            account information. Please do not disclose your account password to
            unauthorized people. We have put in place procedures to deal with
            any suspected Personal data breach and will notify you and any
            applicable regulator of a breach where required to do so.

          <p class="p-regular">
            To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we

            the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
            your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal
            Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
